Our project will be to create a fitness resource:
Our website will have photos of certain muscle groups. 
When these photos are clicked on, it will present a list of workouts for the muscle assigned to that photo.


After the workouts is shown, users can then click on a checkbox next to specific 
workouts. This will reveal information and properties for that target workout.

^^ Above is our MVP, with our goal being the basic functionality of:
1. Rendering Images
2. Making those images interactable
3. Causing that interaction to fetch a list of exercises
4. Rendering checkboxes next to these exercises and allowing the user to interact with those as well
5. Setting the checkbox to pull up that workout's information when clicked 

With this, the website will, at minimum, provide a variety of possible exercises for the user to take note of. 


Once the exercises are shown, users will be able to click on a “like” button that will be next to the exercise. 
This will import that exercise to a “My Workouts” list, where they can 
save workouts that they’d like to use.

Along with the workouts that we provide, there will also be an option 
for the user to input a workout that has not been listed. This will let 
them have more control over customization, so that they can create their 
own personalized workout that can include any workout they’d like to do.

Users will also be able to choose between a light and dark mode when viewing 
the website.
