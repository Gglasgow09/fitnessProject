Our project will be to create a fitness resource:
Our website will have photos of certain muscle groups. 
When these photos are clicked on, it will present a dropdown of more detailed 
muscle groups 
(for example, one muscle group might be legs, and when the photo is clicked,
 it will show glutes, hamstrings, quads, etc). We want this 
 to work similarly to the ramen rater lab.
After the dropdown is shown, users can then click on the specific 
muscles they would like to target. This will reveal exercises for that target muscle, 
where we hope to have a wide variety of options.
Once the exercises are shown, users will be able to do two things:
They can click on a “like” button that will be next to the exercise. 
This will import that exercise to a “favorites” list, where they can 
save workouts that they’d like to use.
They can also achieve this by dragging the workout into the favorites section.
Along with the workouts that we provide, there will also be an option 
for the user to input a workout that has not been listed. This will let 
them have more control over customization, so that they can create their 
own personalized workout that can include any workout they’d like to do.
Each workout will have a small comment (or suggestion) where we may 
recommend certain approaches (some workouts may be better with high weight 
& low volume, and vice versa).
Users will also be able to choose between a light and dark mode when viewing 
the website.
